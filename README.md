# JAVA TETRIS

This is a tetris game I made with java in the fall of 2020.
I was taking a JAVA II course at the time and wanted to practice some of what I had learned in my free time.
I did not follow as many best practices at the time, so I went through and cleaned it up a bit before pushing it to the repo.
The logic used to get the game working was fun to try and figure out.
Looking back at the code, I'm sure I would have done some things differently now, but at the time "IT WORKED!" and I was happy with that.

This game does not follow all of the tetris rules.
You can pause the game and still move the shapes around, it will just not decend on it own.
Your can turn the speed increase off so that it stays the same speed the whole time.
